# A list of papers about audio captioning

## Introduction 

Audio captioning is a novel and exciting research direction, 
focusing on the automatic generation of textual descriptions
(i.e. captions) for general audio. This repository is a list
of papers that are focusing on audio captioning. 

The papers are groupped according to the year that are published,
and for each paper there are: 

* The full citation
* Links to the PDF, e.g. arXiv and/or publisher web site (if applicable)
* A link to the GitHub repository (if applicable)
* A link to pre-trained model(s) (if applicable)

The ordering is descending, having the newer papers first. 

Enjoy!
