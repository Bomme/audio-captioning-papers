# A list of papers about audio captioning

## Introduction 

Audio captioning is a novel and exciting research direction, 
focusing on the automatic generation of textual descriptions
(i.e. captions) for general audio. This repository is a list
of papers that are focusing on audio captioning. 

The papers are groupped according to the year that are published,
and for each paper there are: 

* The full citation
* Links to the PDF, e.g. arXiv and/or publisher web site (if applicable)
* A link to the GitHub repository (if applicable)
* A link to pre-trained model(s) (if applicable)

The ordering is descending, having the newer papers first. 

If you know of an audio captioning paper that is not included
in this list, please make an issue and it will be included!

Enjoy!
